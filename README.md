# Fruit Ninja JavaFX game

This was a project in our OOP course in university, we applied OOP principles to design this game. This game mimicks the original Fruit Ninja game, where a player has limited lives and has to beat his highest score by slicing thrown fruits where scores of the fruits are not the same, also some fruits have special abilities, by slicing bombs user might lose lives and eventually lose the game.
